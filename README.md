# ENGLISH-TO-FRENCH-translation
Machine Translation has become indispensable in the present tech-savvy world to 
reduce the linguistic barrier across borders. English is the most extensively spoken 
language worldwide; therefore, it becomes essential to translate information from 
English to native languages. Early solutions for machine translation used rule-based 
and statistical techniques. A paradigm shift from statistical to neural models 
happened in recent years giving rise to Neural Machine Translation, making it one 
of the most powerful approaches. We propose to develop a Neural Machine 
Translation based Sequence-to-Sequence LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder model to 
translate English to French. Seq2Seq LSTM uses layers of LSTM to create a hidden 
representation of the input sequence using the hidden representations from the 
previous time steps and uses this hidden sequence to decode the sequence in the 
target language. The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metric is used to 
evaluate the quality of the translations.
